            <span class="mv_above">What is a pre-trained model?</span>
            <p class="mv_above_brief">
                A pre-trained model, whether in the visual or textual domain, refers to a machine learning model that
                undergoes initial training on a large and diverse dataset before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. In
                the textual domain, models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are pre-trained on
                extensive text data from the internet, acquiring a comprehensive understanding of language structure,
                context, and semantics. Similarly, in the visual domain, models based on architectures like
                Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as VGG or ResNet, are pre-trained on vast image datasets to
                learn general features and representations of visual data, such as edges and textures. This pre-training
                enables the models to capture broad patterns and knowledge from the data, and they can subsequently be
                fine-tuned for specific applications, like text generation or image classification, resulting in
                improved performance on targeted tasks with potentially less task-specific training data.
            </p>

            <span class="mv_above">Why use pre-trained models?</span>
            <p class="mv_above_brief">
                Pre-trained models are employed in both the visual and textual domains for their ability to leverage
                large and diverse datasets during initial training, capturing general patterns and knowledge inherent in
                the data. In the textual domain, models like GPT learn language nuances, syntactic structures, and
                contextual relationships, providing a foundation for various natural language processing tasks. In the
                visual domain, pre-trained models based on CNNs grasp hierarchical features and representations of
                visual data, facilitating tasks like image classification or object detection. The advantage lies in the
                transferability of knowledge gained during pre-training to specific tasks, allowing for more effective
                and efficient learning with potentially reduced amounts of task-specific training data. This approach
                accelerates model development, enhances performance, and proves particularly valuable when labeled data
                for a specific task is limited, as the pre-trained models have already acquired a broad understanding of
                their respective domains.

                            Key highlights of the paper include:

                            1. *Model Architecture*: DFN-PSAN is built upon the YOLOv5 Backbone and Neck network, which
                            serves as the base structure (DFN). It integrates pyramid squeeze attention (PSA) with
                            multiple convolutional layers to design a novel classification network (PSAN). This
                            architecture enhances the model's ability to extract and fuse multilevel depth information
                            features, highlighting critical regions of plant disease images through pixel-level
                            attention.
